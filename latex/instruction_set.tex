R0 is hard-wired to zero : loading a value from it returns 0,
storing a value in it does nothing. \newline
RLIi : Last instruction executed before the interrupt\newline
LR : link register\newline
LRi : supervisor link register\newline
PC : program counter, always point the next instruction to be executed\newline
Registers R0 to R14 and PC are shared between the sets. \newline
All registers are 64 bit-wide\newline

\newpage
\subsection{Status register and conditional code register}
The whole status register is directly accessible only in supervisor mode, with the instructions TRS and TSR.
In user mode, the current condition codes can be accessed with the instructions TRC and TCR.
The condition codes bits are bit 7 to bit 0. The condition codes bits can be used to perform conditional
operations, such as branches. 
All interrupts move the current status register to the saved status register. And RTI moves back the saved status
to the current status. RTI can be executed only in supervisor mode.

\begin{itemize}
    \item R : if set, R14i to LRi are used instead of R14 to LR
    \item I : if set, interrupt requests are disabled 
    \item D : if set, the MMU doesn't translate the addresses
    \item W : if set, the CPU waits until an interrupt is received. If I is
        set, the processor continues the execution without affecting the PC nor
        the status (except W which is cleared). Otherwise, it performs a
        regular interrupt.
    \item P : if set, the CPU can perform privileged instructions and memory access
    \item N : this status is set if the result of an instruction is negative.
    \item V : this status is set if a signed overflow occurs. A signed overflow has occurred
        when the result has not the expected sign.
    \item H : this status is set if the unsigned result is strictly higher than zero in case of
        a subtraction
    \item g : this status is set for a signed subtraction if the first operand is greater than
        or equal the second operand. 
    \item G : this status is set for a signed subtraction if the first operand is strictly 
        greater than the second operand. 
    \item Z : this status is set when the result is zero.
    \item C : this status is set when an addition has an unsigned result that overflows. In 
        case of a subtraction, this status is set if the unsigned result is higher than or equal 
        than zero. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Interrupts}

\paragraph{For all interrupts : }
The CPU starts executing instruction at a predefined address, swaps the register set, 
and saves  the current PC in LRi, saves the current status to the saved status and 
dumps the last instruction tried into the RLIi register.
The status bits D, I, R and P are set, and W is cleared. An interrupt servicing routine has to
be quitted with the instruction RTI to restore the PC and the saved status.
For multicore systems, \$100 multiplied by the core number is added to the jump address.
The highest priority number is the least prioritised interrupt.

            This interrupt has to be triggered on power on. After the reset,
            only the core 0 is started. For the other cores, the status and the
            PC are initialised, but the W status is left set.\\

            It aborts the current instruction.
            The faulty instruction is dumped into RLIi. \newline
            \textbf {Warning :} we assume that no memory error will occur during an interrupt servicing
            routine. However, if it happens anyway, the CPU will overwrite the LRi. (But if a memory error
            happen in an ISR, your system is probably already really f**ked up) \\

            AE   & \texttt{\$00000000 00000004} & 3 & Address error &

\section{Addressing modes}

\subsection{Memory operations}
In this section EA stands for effective address

\paragraph{direct mode : (d)}

offset (15 bits signed --- 32 KiB range)

EA = offset

\paragraph{index mode : (i)}

Rx, offset (10 bits signed --- 1 KiB range)

EA = Rx + offset

\paragraph{base index shifted mode : (bi) }

Rx, Ry \textless\textless shift (shift amount on 5 bits)

EA = Rx + Ry \textless\textless shift

\paragraph{auto-indexing mode : (ai) }

\subparagraph{Rx, Ry+}

Ry += data\_size

\subparagraph{Rx, Ry-}

EA = Rx + Ry then Ry -= data\_size

\subparagraph{Rx, +Ry}

Ry += data\_size then EA = Rx + Ry

\subparagraph{Rx, -Ry}

Ry -= data\_size then EA = Rx + Ry


\paragraph{Important notes : }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every memory access has to be aligned. If not, a MAM interrupt is raised. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If a double-word is accessed, it must be aligned on double-word
                (The least significant nibble is 0 or 8). 
            ¬†\item if a word is accessed, it must be word aligned (the least significant nibble of
                the address has to be either 0, 4, 8 or C). 
            \item If it is a half-word, the address has to be even.
            \item For a byte, every address can be accessed. 
        \end{itemize}

    \item The PC is a valid register for addressing. In addition, the PC is always word 
        aligned. 

    \item The endianess is little. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ALU operations}

\paragraph{register mode : (rr)}
\texttt{Rx, Ry [<< <left\_shift\_amount (4 bits)>]}

S1 = Rx, S2 = Ry (left shifted by left\_shift\_amount)

\paragraph{immediate mode : (rim)}
\texttt{Rx, \#<immediate\_value>}

S1 = Rx, S2 = immediate\_value (9 bits signed)

\subsection{Branch operations}

\paragraph{relative to register mode : (r)}
offset

PC = Rx + offset (14 bits signed left shifted by 2 --- 64 KiB range)

\newpage
\subsection{Atomic memory operations}

\paragraph{LLD} --- load link double-word\newline
Loads a double-word from memory to a register. The load address is
stored in a hidden register, the load link register, and the dirty bit of this
register is cleared. If a store occures on this address, the dirty bit will be
set.

\paragraph{SCD} --- store conditional double-word\newline
Stores a double-word in memory from a register if the address of the target is

operation will cause another LLD / SCD on the same address to fail. If the
memory wasn't locked with LLD, the operation will fail. A core can't handle
more than one LLD / SCD at a time.

\section{Assembler syntax}
\subsection{Memory operations}
Rd is the register source in case of a store, Rd is the destination register
in case of a load. The next values are for the addressing mode.
options between \textless \textgreater mean required, options between [] mean optional

\subsection{ALU operations}
Rd is the destination register. The next values are for the addressing mode.
Options between \textless \textgreater mean required, options between [] mean
optional

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{rr : FOO <Rd>, <Rx>, <Ry> [<LSL|ASL|ROL|LSR|ASR|ROR>

General syntax for the documentation :
\newline
General form : \texttt{FOO D, S1, S2}

\subsection{Branch operations}
The values are for the addressing mode.
Options between \textless \textgreater mean required, options between [] mean
optional
For 3 operands : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{i : BAR <Rx> [, offset]}
    \item \texttt{i : BAR [PC,] <offset>}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Status instructions and conditional codes instructions}

Rd is the destination for TSR and TCR, and Rd is the source for TRS and TCR.
RTI does not have any addressing mode.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{implied : TRC <Rd>}
    \item \texttt{implied : TCR <Rd>}
    \item \texttt{implied : TRS <Rd>}
    \item \texttt{implied : TSR <Rd>}
    \item \texttt{none : RTI }

\subsection{Software interrupts}

Software interrupts don't have any addressing mode. 
However, a 19 bits numeric constant can be added to a SYS opcode. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{none : SYS [\#constant]}
    \item \texttt{none : ILG }
\end{itemize}
